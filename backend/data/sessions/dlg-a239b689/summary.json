  "text": "To use a drain snake to unclog a drain, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Gather your tools and materials. You will need a drain snake, a rag, a 1/8 hand auger, a utility knife, a small bowl or bucket, and petroleum jelly.\n\nStep 2: Remove the P-trap from the drain. Follow the instructions in your local manual or the manual provided with the drain snake.\n\nStep 3: Place the end of the drain snake down the drain pipe. Bending the tip of the auger at a 45\u00b0 angle helps get around the bend and elbows of the pipe.\n\nStep 4: Start with 1 foot (30.5cm) of the auger at the bottom of the drain. Work your way up the pipe, turning the drum to extend the snake.\n\nStep 5: Use the utility knife to cut the pipe tape and plumbers putty around the lip of the MBber plunger. This will help prevent the snake from getting stuck.\n\nStep 6: Apply petroleum jelly around the lip of the MBber plunger. This will help prevent the snake from getting stuck.\n\nStep 7: Place the end of the drain snake in the drain and turn the drum to extend the snake.\n\nStep 8: Continue working your way up the pipe, turning the drum to extend the snake.\n\nStep 9: Once you have reached the top of the pipe, remove the drain snake and clean the inside of the pipe with a rag.\n\nStep 10: Apply petroleum jelly around the lip of the MBber plunger again. This will help prevent the snake from getting stuck.\n\nStep 11: Place the end of the drain snake in the drain and turn the drum to extend the snake.\n\nStep 12: Continue working your way up the pipe, turning the drum to extend the snake.\n\nStep 13: Once you have reached the top of the pipe, remove the drain snake and clean the inside of the pipe with a rag.\n\nStep 14: Apply petroleum jelly around the lip of the MBber plunger again.
