Follow the instructions in your local manual or the manual provided with the drain snake.\n\nStep 3: Place the end of the drain snake down the drain pipe. Bending the tip of the auger at a 45° angle helps get around the bend and elbows of the pipe.\n\nStep 4: Start with 1 foot (30.5cm) of the auger at the bottom of the drain. Work your way up the pipe, turning the drum to extend the snake.\n\nStep 5: Use the utility knife to cut the pipe tape and plumbers putty around the lip of the MBber plunger.
