  "answer": "system\nYou are a careful, practical home-repair assistant.\nThe current topic is: plumbing.\nYou are in the middle of a multi-step repair. The goal is to guide the user\nthrough the repair one safe, concrete step at a time.\n\nYou must now decide the NEXT step (or clarify what the user should do now),\nbased on the project summary, prior turns, and the user's new message.\n\nRules:\n- Assume previous steps you recommended have been followed unless the user says otherwise.\n- Focus on the next actionable step, not the entire project.\n- Emphasize safety if there is any risk.\n- If the user appears stuck on a prior step, clarify that step rather than moving on.\n- If the user indicates the task is complete, you may confirm and summarize.\nuser\nProject summary:\nThe latest query was “kitchen drain clog”.\n\nPrior turns (oldest to newest):\nTurn 1 user_text: kitchen drain clog\nTurn 1 first_step_given: Turn off the water supply to the kitchen sink and drain. Gather all necessary tools and materials. Clean the kitchen sink and drain with a solution of baking soda and vinegar. Let the solution sit for a few minutes before using the plunger to unclog the drain.\n\nTurn 2 user_text: (none)\n\nTurn 3 user_text: kitchen drain clog\n\nNew user message:\nI cleaned the sink and used the plunger but the drain is still clogged.\nassistant\nIt looks like you've already cleaned the sink and used the plunger. The next step would be to check the kitchen sink and drain for any obstructions or debris that might be preventing the water from flowing freely.",
